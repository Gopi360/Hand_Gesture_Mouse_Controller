# 🤚 Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse

This project allows you to control your mouse using just your **hand gestures** via a webcam. It uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect hand landmarks and perform actions like **moving the cursor**, **left click** (by touching index and thumb), and **right click** (by touching index and middle finger).

## ✨ Features

- 🖱️ Move mouse cursor with index finger
- 👆 Left click by touching **index finger and thumb**
- 👉 Right click by touching **index and middle finger**
- Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe**
- No physical mouse needed

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.8
- [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/)
